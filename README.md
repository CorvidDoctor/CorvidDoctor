<h1 align = "center"> WHAT DO I KNOW? </h1>
<p align = "center"> Currently, I am a high school senior who studies both Computer Science and Psychology, with the hope of becoming a psychologist one day! </p>
<p align = "center"> But, in the meantime, I work on CS projects--like making really bad video games! </p>
<p align = "center"> I have my Microsoft IT Certification as well. </p>

<h2> Languages I know: </h2>
<h2> • HTML </h2>
<h2> • CSS </h2>
<h2> • JavaScript </h2>
<h2> • Java </h2>

<p> I am most comfortable working with Java right now. </p>
